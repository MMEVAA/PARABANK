## Project Description:

Parabank is a virtual banking application that represents a simulated environment for testing and simulating financial
transactions. It is not a real financial institution but is used in place of a real banking application during software
testing.

The test environments provided above are designed for performing various operations that users can execute in a
web-based banking application. They are valuable tools for simulating financial transactions such as account creation,
money transfers, credit application submissions, and bill payments. They are utilized for implementing various test
scenarios.

The environment we will use for this sprint: [https://parabank.parasoft.com/](https://parabank.parasoft.com/)
